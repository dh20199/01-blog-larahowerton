            As a concluding note, it is interesting to ask the question of who might have seen this particular
            representation of Roger and understood the message that it conveyed. In all likelihood, these were not
            actually the trappings of power that Roger would have worn. There are very few other representations of
            Roger, but it is evident that the Martorana portrait belies the reality of what Roger wore. It especially
            minimizes the other traditions that Roger incorporated into his royal image. Roger's mantle, now part of the
            coronation garments of the Holy Roman Emperor, provides the best example of this: its motifs come from the
            Muslim world rather than the Byzantine one, its Arabic inscription in Kufic script addresses Roger in the
            manner of an Islamic ruler, and the inscription even gives the year according to the Hijri calendar. Later
            depictions of Roger, such as the miniatures in the manuscript of Peter of Eboli produced roughly 50 years
            after Roger's death, show Roger in more western clothing that bears little resemblance to mantle or the
            Byzantine garb of the mosaic portrait (fig. 13). It is clear that the actual image of Roger's kingship went
            far beyond that proclaimed by the mosaic in Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio. It was much more complex and
            far-reaching than a simple borrowing of Byzantine forms; he also drew on elements from the Islamic world and
            Roman heritage, among other things. Roger's world was a hybrid one, bridging east and west, Christian and
            Islamic, and merging the Latin-, Greek-, and Arabic-speaking worlds. It is certain that Roger would not
            have worn the trappings of a Byzantine emperor regularly, if at all, and it is certain that not all viewers
            would have read the nuances of the message proclaimed by the Martorana portrait.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, the most critical aspect is not the reality of the portrait but the fact of its existence. It
            is key that someone, probably George of Antioch, decided to cast Roger in the mold of a Byzantine emperor,
            with all of the accompanying implications. This image of Roger became one of the myriad images associated
            with the concept of Norman kingship. The image of the basileus and his red shoes lingered, and it served as
            the model for other representations of Norman kings, such as the dedicatory mosaic of William II at
            Monreale. Over time, these symbols of royal power became incorporated into the Sicilian koine. They were
            originally used in the Martorana mosaic at the discretion of George of Antioch, a man who was intimately
            familiar with their roots in the Byzantine tradition and the subtleties of the rhetoric, such as Mary's ruby
            slippers. Whether or not the shoes retained their Marian associations, and whether viewers would have
            connected that with the Byzantine concept of two courts is uncertain. However, it is certain that during
            Roger's reign, every tool at Roger's disposal—including putting Mary's ruby slippers on his feet—was used to
            exalt Roger and to proclaim the majesty, sacrality, and legitimacy of Roger's rule.
